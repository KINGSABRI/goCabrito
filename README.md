## Qs & As 
### Why not use goPhish?
goPhish is a gerat choice too. But I prefer flexibility and simplicity at the same time. I used goPhish various times but at somepoint, I'm either find it overwhelming or inflexible. 

Most of the time, I don't need all these statistics, I just need a flixable way to prepare my phishing campaigns and send them. Each time I use goPhish I've to go and check the documentations about how to add a website, forward specific requests, etc. So I created [goCabrito](https://github.com/KINGSABRI/goCabrito) and [getCabrito](https://github.com/KINGSABRI/getCabrito).

getCabrito optionally generates unique URL for email tracking.
- Email Opening  tracking: Tracking Pixel 
- Email Clicking tracking

by generate a hash for each email and append it to the end of the URL or image URL and store these information along with other things that are useful for getCabrito to import and servering. **This feature is the only thing connects goCabrito with getCabrito script, so no panic!.**

### What's with the "Cabrito" thing?
It's just a name of once of my favorit resturants and the name was chosen by one of my team.

### How you really use it? 
1. I create directory for each customer
2. Under the customer's directory, I create a directory for each campaign. This sub directory contains
  - The profile
  - The To, CC & BCC lists in CSV format
  - The message body in HTML format
4. I configure the profile and prepare my HTML
3. Execute the campaign profile in `dry` mode first (check the profile file `dry` value)
```
ruby goCabrito.rb -P CUSTOMER/3/camp3.json --dry
```
4. I remove the `--dry` switch and make sure the `dry` value is `false` in the config file
5. Send to a test email
6. Send to the real lists

## Troublesheooting 
### SMTP authentication issues
Nowadays, many cloud-based email vendors block SMTP authentication by default (e.g. Office365, GSuite). This of course will cause an error. To solve this, here are some steps to help you enabling AMTP authentication on different vendors.

#### Enable SMTP Auth Office 365
To globally enabling SMTP Auth, use powershell. 

- Support SSL For Linux/Nix (run pwsh as sudo required)
```powershell
$ sudo pwsh
```

- Install PSWSMan
```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSWSMan -Scope AllUsers
Install-WSMan
```

- Install ExchangeOnline Module
```powershell
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement
```

- Load ExchangeOnline Module
```powershell
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
```

- Connect to Office365 exchange using the main admin user, it will prompt you to enter credentials. 
```powershell
Connect-ExchangeOnline -InlineCredential
```
The above command will prompt you to enter Office365 admin's credentials 
```
  PowerShell credential request
  Enter your credentials.
  User: admin@domain.onmicrosoft.com
  Password for user admin@domain.onmicrosoft.com: **********
```

- Or us this to open web browser to enter your credentils incase of 2FA.
```powershell
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName admin@pifsaudi.onmicrosoft.com 
```

- Enable SMTP AUTH Gloabally 
```powershell
Set-TransportConfig -SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled $false
```

- To Enable for SMTP Auth for specific email
```powershell
Set-CASMailbox -Identity uuu@ccc.com -SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled $false
Get-CASMailbox -Identity uuu@ccc.com | Format-List SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled
```

- Confirm
```powershell
Get-TransportConfig | Format-List SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled
```

Then follow the following steps 
1. Go to Asure portal (https://aad.portal.azure.com/) from admin panel (https://admin.microsoft.com/)
2. Select **All Services**
3. Select **Tenant Properties**
4. Click **Manage Security defaults**
5. Select **No** Under **Enable Security defaults**
